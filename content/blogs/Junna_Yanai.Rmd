# Below are some of the basics analysis that I have done in my Master's program:

# Gapminder Analysis

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

## Country data and continent data

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "Japan")

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

## Country (Japan) life expectency 

```{r, lifeExp_one_country}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
  NULL
plot1
```

## Entering the title and axes

```{r, lifeExp_one_country_with_label}
 plot1<- plot1 +
   labs(title = "Japan Life Expectancy",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy") +
   NULL


 plot1
```

In Japan, the life expectancy has grown significantly since the 1950s as it become an industrial developed nation. This is because Japan experienced high death rates and low living standards during wartime but now is one of the most medically advanced countries in the world. 

## Life expectancy in Asia

```{r lifeExp_one_continent}
 ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x =year , y =lifeExp  , colour= country, group = country))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   NULL
```

We can see from this graph that the life expectancy is on an upward trend in every country in Asia. This is because the living standards and health of individuals in these countries are improving as the countries become more developed. 

## World life expectancy by continent

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
 ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour= continent))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position="none") + #remove all legends
   NULL
```

Life expectancy is increasing in all parts of the world. Asian countries like Japan and Korea tend to have higher life expectancy compared to other countries throughout the years, and the average stands around 80 years old. The reason why these countries tend to have higher life expectencies is supposedly due to healthier diet and lack of patients from diseases like heart disease which are caused from obesity. People from western countries tend to suffer from such health problems, and people from poor countries lack access to healthcare.  

# Brexit vote analysis

## Brexit data
```{r load_brexit_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
brexit_results <- read_csv(here::here("data","brexit_results.csv"))


glimpse(brexit_results)
```

## Distribution of leave % in all constituencies
```{r brexit_histogram, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# histogram
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5)

# density plot-- think smoothed histogram
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_density()


# The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) 
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
  


```

## Correlation between leave share and born in UK status
```{r brexit_immigration_correlation}
brexit_results %>% 
  select(leave_share, born_in_uk) %>% 
  cor()
```

# Scatterplot between leaveshare and born in UK
```{r brexit_immigration_plot}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  
  # add a smoothing line, and use method="lm" to get the best straight-line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  
  # use a white background and frame the plot with a black box
  theme_bw() +
  NULL
```

The correlation between individuals born in the UK who have voted to leave the EU is high. Individuals who are born in the UK are UK citizens who have not immigrated to live in the country, hence their mentality towards the EU and the ease of currency exchange and immigration, as well as lack of flexibility for individual member countries for policy and public financing contributed to UK born citizens voting to leave the UK at higher rates that other groups. 

# Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

## Data on animal rescue
```{r load_animal_rescue_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/8a7d91c2-9aec-4bde-937a-3998f4717cd8/Animal%20Rescue%20incidents%20attended%20by%20LFB%20from%20Jan%202009.csv"

animal_rescue <- read_csv(url,
                          locale = locale(encoding = "CP1252")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


glimpse(animal_rescue)
```

## Animal rescue count
```{r, instances_by_calendar_year}

animal_rescue %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(cal_year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())

animal_rescue %>% 
  count(cal_year, name="count")

```

There is no evident trend for the number of animal incident count, as seen above. 


## Animal Group Percentages

```{r, animal_group_percentages}
animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  #group_by and summarise will produce a new column with the count in each animal group
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  
  # mutate adds a new column; here we calculate the percentage
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2)) %>% 
  
  # arrange() sorts the data by percent. Since the default sorting is min to max and we would like to see it sorted
  # in descending order (max to min), we use arrange(desc()) 
  arrange(desc(percent))


animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min
  count(animal_group_parent, name="count", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2))


```

As we can see from the percentages above, cats are almost half of the animal incidents that happen in absolute numbers. This is most likely because they are freely roaming around neighborhoods where humans live. They are vulnerable to cars running them over. 

## Animal Rescue dataframe 

```{r, parse_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# what type is variable incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue`
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

# readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers
animal_rescue <- animal_rescue %>% 

  # we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now 'double' or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

```

## Summary statistics

```{r, stats_on_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

animal_rescue %>% 
  
  # group by animal_group_parent
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(desc(mean_incident_cost))

```

First, I notice that the standard deviation is bigger for animals with higher incident costs and also that the median cost is clearly smaller than the mean costs. From this we can interpret that larger animals like horses, cows, and deers can get into accidents that can cost the most, but the price varied widely. This is not a surprise. In terms of outliers, we see that they mainly involve higher prices rather than lower prices. For instance, the maximum price for horse incidents is 3480, which is over 3 standard deviations away from the mean. Same goes for deers. 

## Plots on incident cost by animals group
```{r, plots_on_incident_cost_by_animal_group,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# base_plot
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()
base_plot + geom_density()
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```

The histogram and box and whisker plot are most useful when communicating this information because it it clearly shows the distribution and the outliers. The line graph is more fit to represent data on continuous x values such as time. Based on the distribution of the above graphs, we can see that smaller rodent animals such as rabbits and ferrets have an even distribution that are less skewed compared to other animals. Animals such as horses and cows tend to be skewed to the right, with clear outliers for heavier incidents. However, these animals are still more expensive, as can be observed from the median values. This is most likely because they can cause larger impact at the incident scene as compared to smaller animals.
